Recipe Redux is an innovative web application to simplify the culinary experience by providing users with various recipes based on the ingredients they already have in their pantry. Recipes can be filtered based on numerous options such as cuisine type, dietary restrictions, nutritional information, and more. Recipe Redux was created in Visual Studio in C# and utilizes Razor Pages, Entity Framework Core, and a recipe-based API to provide an aesthetically pleasing and efficient experience for users. The project will be presented by Devin Rayfield at 11:00am on Tuesday, May 7th in DUE 2183. It will also be streamed live on Zoom at https://bit.ly/cis598s24b.
